# Othello

The goal of the game is to have the majority of disks on the board be in your color at the end of the game.

## Rules

The game starts with four disks placed in a square in the middle of the grid, two for each player, arranged with alternate colors. Players take turns placing their own colored disk on the board in such a way that captures one or more of the opponent's disks by enclosing them between their own disks.

## Moves

A legal move must do at least one of the following:

- Place a disk in a position that encloses at least one of the opponent's disks.
Capture one or more of the opponent's disks by enclosing them between their own disks.
- A player may not pass their turn unless they have no legal moves available. The game ends when there are no more legal moves available for either player or when the board is completely filled with disks.


## Who wins?

At the end of the game, all of the disks on the board are counted and the player with the most disks in their color wins. If both players have the same number of disks, then the game is a tie.

## How to start?

Simply run the `othello.py` file in your Python interpreter, CLI will appear and you can start
the game with inserting coordinates of disk you want to reveal!
